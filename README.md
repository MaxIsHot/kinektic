# Kinektic 2

Official github were you can report your issues so we could improve the pack.

### Getting started

Kinektic 2 runs via Minecraft's native libraries and requires [Java](https://java.com/en/download/) to run.

It is imperative that you have the Java version downloaded that your system uses for optimised performance. (64bit systems should use 64bit java and so forth) This is especially important if you wish to host a server yourself!
>The Kinektic 2 pack is primarily hosted and supposed to be run via [The Technic Launcher](https://www.technicpack.net/download)
>Simply install the launcher, sign in with your Minecraft credentials and search for Kinektic 2 on the browser.
